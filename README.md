# BulletGod
An action-packed bullet hell game featuring a SINGLE boss. As the player, your goal is to defeat this challenging boss.

Note: Excluding creating sprites, this game took me a little more than 3 hours to develop. Due to this time constraint, this game has no sound or story. Simply the goal is to beat the boss.

Controls: 
WASD -> Move
Space -> Dodge
LMB -> Shoot
ESC -> Quit
